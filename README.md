# Quiz App

![Quiz App Preview](Preview.png)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out my Quiz App project!

This is an interactive quiz application built as part of my frontend development learning journey. It tests your knowledge of web development fundamentals — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## The Project

The goal was to build a fully functional quiz app that feels smooth and responsive. Users should be able to:

- Start the quiz and read the rules before beginning
- Answer 50 multiple choice questions
- See a **15 second countdown timer** for each question
- Get instant feedback — green for correct ✅, red for wrong ❌
- View their final score at the end
- Restart or quit the quiz

## Built With

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click **Start Quiz** and enjoy!

## What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Working with timers using `setInterval` and `clearInterval`
- Dynamically creating and updating HTML elements with JS
- Styling with Tailwind CSS utility classes

**Have fun quizzing!**
